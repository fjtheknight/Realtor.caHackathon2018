# Sponsoring
Benefits of financial institutions sponsoring listings:
-    Sellers :
o    Better visibility of listing
o    “Proof of good property”
o    => Faster selling
-    Buyers :
o    Financial benefits (lower interest rates, offers from financial institutions’ partners…)
o    More confidence (sponsored = “good” choice)
o    Faster process (financial institution that is ready to give you money to buy the property)
-    Realtors :
o    Sponsorship from financial institutions
o    More active market = more income
-    Financial institutions :
o    Increased potential of getting new customers and the ability to choose customers with lower risk rates
o    Encouraging investment in specific type of properties or areas (field of expertise of the financial institution or partner institutions)
o    More income (direct = mortgages and indirect = buyer may need loan for other investments related to the property)

# Realtor rating system:
Adding a rating system that indicates how good is a realtor at certain areas or type of properties:
- What is their field/area of expertise (agriculture, residential, vacant lands...; Ottawa/Gatineau area, City of Toronto...)
- How good are they at saving/making money (compare original listing price to closing price)
- How fast are they at concluding deals (compare listing date to closing date)
- How good are they at communicating with people (customer satisfaction factor)

# Property search improvements:
- Select locations (ex: uOttawa + Rideau center / radius: 2 km) instead of areas so results will show houses whithin your radius of interest.
